<strong>Game Design</strong>

The template game level called After Interstellar, basically explains what cooper (main character of movie "Interstellar" have met after into the black hole. There are instanced trees and a sea being affect by the black hole and a 4D creature (TRex, who saved copper) is able to talks to you. Player, as first person of copper, can only move forward (limited by collision), talk to TRex and exit.

<strong>Techniques</strong>

Besides the given use of DX12 APIs, the game incorporates Bidirectional Reflection Distance Field, attenuation in lighting, transparent mesh, texture mapping for opaque mesh, alpha-tested leaves, vertex-animated leaves and sea, instancing of trees with simple procedural generation, TRex interaction by animation controller, simple AABB collision, normal mapping, faked displacement mapping, Gerstner-based water flowing and a fixed Sky Sphere and so on.
