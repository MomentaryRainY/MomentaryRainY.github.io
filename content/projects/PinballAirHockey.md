<strong>Game Design</strong>

The main idea to make game frantic is promoting competition between two players. Game prototype is traditional pinball, but supporting two players. Game has two modes, two player playing in their own area, get buffer by hitting monsters to get points, or increasing opponents's difficulty by hitting items, making them losing health. There are five kinds of collision items, effects are size+, size-, speed+, count+, and teleport. In two modes, items affect local/opponent area.
